/**
 * Catalog reads that take no input, cached across requests.

 * Both answer the same question on every visit — the price and remaining-life
 * bounds of the sellable stock, and the list of sizes in stock — yet `/tires`
 * used to ask SQL Server again each time. Measured in production on
 * 2026-09-25, `tires.ranges` was among the slowest of the 9–11 queries a single
 * `/tires` render fires (0,8–2,3 s), and each render holds a connection from a
 * pool of ten for as long as its slowest query runs.
 *
 * Five minutes is well inside what the stock can tolerate: the ranges only set
 * where the sliders start and end, and the sizes only decide whether a complete
 * size has a landing page. Neither decides whether a tire is shown or sold.
