/**
 * A facet count is a promise: "pick this and you will see 825 tires." The page
 * behind it is built by a different query, and if the two ever describe
 * different sets, the promise breaks in the least debuggable way — nothing
 * throws, nothing logs, the number is simply a lie.
 *
 * Both are `STOREFRONT_SELLABLE_WHERE` plus `buildFiltersClause(filters)`. This
 * asserts that, filter by filter, rather than trusting that they were written
 * from the same intention. Confirmed once against the live catalogue on
 * 2026-08-25: the results count and the facet grand total were both **4.127**,
 * and each of the nine groups summed to exactly that.
