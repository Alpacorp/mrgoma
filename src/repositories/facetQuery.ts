/**
 * How many tires sit behind each filter option.
 *
 * The catalog used to offer options without saying what was behind them: of the
 * 1.610 brand × rim combinations `/tires` presented, **only 338 had stock**, so
 * four clicks in five landed on "No Tires Found". A count beside every option
 * removes the guess, and an option built from the data cannot offer a size the
 * warehouse does not have — or hide one it does.
 *
 * **One pass, not one per facet.** Seven separate `GROUP BY` queries over
 * `dbo.View_Tires` — a fifteen-table join — cost seven scans and were measured
 * at 876 ms. `GROUPING SETS` asks for all of them in a single scan: **244 ms
 * server-side for seven, re-measured at nine.** No index, no cache, no schema
 * change; the difference is entirely in how the question is asked.
 *
 * Every WHERE comes from `buildFiltersClause`, the same builder the results use.
 * Two hand-written translations of "what this filter means" would eventually
 * disagree, and the symptom — a count promising tires the next page does not
 * show — is the least debuggable kind of wrong.
