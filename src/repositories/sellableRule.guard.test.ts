/**
 * "A tire we may sell online" is one rule: not local, not trashed, not sold, at
 * least 50% life left, and priced. It decides what the catalog shows, what the
 * Google Merchant feed publishes and what every facet counts.
 *
 * It existed twice — `STOREFRONT_SELLABLE_WHERE` and a character-identical
 * literal inside `fetchBrands`. Identical copies are the dangerous kind: nothing
 * fails while they agree, and nothing warns when one is edited. The same shape
 * is called out for consent rules in `tech-stack.md`, for the WhatsApp number in
 * `019` and for the store hours in `018`.
 *
 * So: the sentence may be written **once**, where the constant is defined.
 */

/**
 * The whole sentence, not a fragment. `Condition != 'sold'` alone also appears
 * in rules that are deliberately different — `fetchActiveTireIds` and the
 * dimension queries apply no life test at all — and flagging those would push
 * towards unifying rules that genuinely differ.
