/**
 * The catalog's filter links, as `robots.txt` patterns — each parameter in both
 * positions, for the same reason as `_rsc` below: a rule anchored on `?` misses
 * the parameter whenever it is not the first one in the query string.
 *
 * Every option in the filter rail is a real `<Link>` (see `FacetGroup.tsx`), and
 * `/tires` is rendered on every request with its facet queries against SQL
 * Server. Multi-select brands × condition × price × remaining life × the rest is
 * an unbounded number of URLs, and all of them canonicalise back to `/tires`. In
 * September 2026 Applebot alone was fetching ~244.000 of them a day, each one a
 * cache miss and a round of database queries, for pages that can never rank.
 *
 * **Deliberately not listed:** `page`. `tiresMetadata` gives pagination a
 * self-referencing canonical, so page 2 of the catalog is a page we ask Google
 * to reach.
 *
 * **The size parameters `w`, `s`, `d` are listed (038).** They were left open in
 * `036` on the reasoning that a complete size folds into its `/tires/size/{slug}`
 * landing page. What that missed is that the rail links **partial** sizes too —
 * width alone, rim alone, width and profile — thousands of combinations that
 * canonicalise to `/tires` and are no page we publish. With every other facet
 * closed they became the one open door, and two days after `036` the catalog was
 * still rendering ~158.000 times a day: always page 1, a different handful of
 * tires each time, 9 to 11 queries against SQL Server per request.
 *
 * Closing them costs nothing we rank for. A complete size is published as its
 * landing page, which is in the sitemap and served from the ISR cache — the
 * canonical already points there. The only URLs lost are page 2+ of a complete
 * size on `/tires`, which exist for the handful of sizes with more than twenty
 * tires in stock.

           * `&_rsc=`. With only the first pattern, every prefetch of a filtered
           * catalog link stays crawlable — the larger half of the problem.
           *
           * This does not change what a visitor gets: prefetching still runs, it
           * just stops being something a crawler follows.
