 * combinations `/tires` offered, only 338 had stock.
 *
 * **Every option is a `<Link>`, not a button.** Filtering is navigation: the
 * result is a real URL that can be shared, indexed and reached without
 * JavaScript. That is also why the applied option is marked with `aria-current`
 * rather than `aria-pressed` — `aria-pressed` belongs to a button role, and
 * `/tires` was emitting **254 invalid ones** on a single page before this
 * feature.
 *
 * A server component: it holds no state and must not ship to the browser.
