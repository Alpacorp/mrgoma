 * Feature 041 broke the production build once: `TireInformation` imported the
 * set block, which reads the database through `mssql`, and `TireInformation` is
 * exported from the `@/app/ui/sections` barrel that client components import.
 * Turbopack then tried to bundle `mssql` (and `dgram`, `dns`) for the browser.
 *
 * The fix passes the block in as `setSlot` from `DetailView`. These checks keep
 * the database side out of the barrel's reach.
