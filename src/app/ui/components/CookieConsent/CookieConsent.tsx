/**
 * CookieConsent — the site's only consent control.
 *
 * - Shows on a first visit until the visitor decides.
 * - Accept: recorded for a year, and the banner does not return.
 * - Decline: no persistent "false" is stored; the banner simply stays quiet for
 *   a while. How long depends on what the visitor is saying no *to* —
 *   `DECLINE_DAYS` for a first-visit "not now", `WITHDRAW_DAYS` for someone
 *   deliberately reversing an earlier yes, because asking that person again
 *   tomorrow would be nagging.
 * - Reopens on a `cookies:reopen` event, which the footer control dispatches.
 *   That is what makes withdrawal as easy as consenting: the same banner, the
 *   same two buttons, no extra page.
 *
 * All reading and writing of consent goes through `consent.ts`, never inline —
 * two copies of that rule is how they start to disagree.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a `<dialog>`. A modal would trap focus and block
 * the page for a notice that must not obstruct anything; a non-modal region is
 * the right shape, at the cost of handling Escape ourselves (see below).
