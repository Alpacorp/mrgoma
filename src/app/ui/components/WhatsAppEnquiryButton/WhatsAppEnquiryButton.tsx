/**
 * A one-tap route to a person, with the tire already described.
 *
 * **A Server Component on purpose.** The detail page renders on the server by
 * design (`003-detail-server-render`) and the message's inputs are all known at
 * render time, so this needs no `'use client'`, no hydration boundary and no
 * runtime message build — the `href` ships in the initial HTML.
 *
 * Tracking is declarative too: `InteractionTracker` listens for `data-track`
 * from one delegated listener in the root layout, so marking the element is the
 * whole of the instrumentation. `surface` separates this from the WhatsApp
 * actions on the contact, guide, location and service pages, following the
 * vocabulary `018` established rather than minting a new event name — one
 * behaviour split across two names makes the totals unanswerable.
 *
 * The style is a **neutral slate outline**, not the brand green. Add to cart is
 * a filled `green-600` button, so anything green here would compete with it;
 * a neutral outline is visibly the quieter option and keeps the purchase path
 * first.
