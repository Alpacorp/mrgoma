/**
 * The box is **5:1**, not 4:1, because that is the shape of these logos.
 *
 * Measured across all 161 files: the median brand mark is **5.2:1** — tire
 * brands are wordmarks, not emblems. In the old 128×32 box the width ran out
 * first for most of them, so they were drawn well short of the box height: the
 * median filled 25 of 32 px and an 8:1 mark like Hankook or General only 16.
 * They read as thin strips beside the price.
 *
 * At 160×32 the median mark fills 31 px of the 32, and the widest gain a quarter
 * of their size. The nine square-ish logos are unaffected — they were already
 * height-limited.
 *
 * The row wraps, so the extra 32 px costs nothing on a narrow card.
