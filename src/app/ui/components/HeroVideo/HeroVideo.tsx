/**
 * The hero's decorative background video.
 *
 * Muted autoplay is not something markup can guarantee, so this is a client
 * component. Two refusals were observed on a real iPhone:
 *
 *  - **Safari under Low Power Mode** blocks autoplay outright; with it off the
 *    video starts on its own.
 *  - **Chrome for iOS refuses always.** It runs on WebKit like every iOS
 *    browser, but its WKWebView host requires a user gesture for any playback
 *    regardless of muting or battery mode.
 *
 * Both explain the original report — the video played after navigating away and
 * back because that tap granted the document user activation, and a `play()`
 * under activation is never refused. So playback is attempted in three widening
 * rings: at mount, again once the media is decodable (`preload="metadata"` may
 * leave nothing to play on the first try), and finally on the visitor's first
 * interaction anywhere on the page — the one moment iOS will not say no. People
 * reach for the search controls within a second or two, so it does start.
 *
 * The poster lives on a sibling layer rather than in the element's `poster`
 * attribute, and the video fades in only once it is genuinely playing. That is
 * what keeps WebKit's play-button overlay off the hero: the platform draws that
 * glyph over any video that hasn't started, `controls={false}` notwithstanding,
 * and it was showing through the search card. A transparent element has nothing
 * to draw. Styling `::-webkit-media-controls-start-playback-button` is the usual
 * advice, but it is a non-standard pseudo-element that was observed doing
 * nothing in Chrome for iOS, so it stays only as a backstop in globals.css.
 *
 * `src` sits on the element rather than in a `<source>` child on purpose:
 * WebKit evaluates autoplay eligibility as part of resource selection, and the
 * child form has it decide before the resource is settled.
 *
 * `preload` stays at `metadata` so the ~3 MB file does not compete with the
 * poster that wins the LCP race (see spec/features/002-lcp-fetchpriority) — and
 * the poster is now a plain background layer, painted from the very same
 * preloaded file.
 *
 * Motion is opt-out: `prefers-reduced-motion` leaves the poster in place.
