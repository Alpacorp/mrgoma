    title: 'Treadwear rating',
    description:
      'A numerical indicator that predicts the tire\'s tread life. A higher number indicates a longer expected tread life. For example, a tire with a 400 treadwear rating should last twice as long as a tire with a 200 rating, under the same conditions.',

    title: 'Temperature rating',
    description:
      'Measures a tire\'s resistance to heat generation and its ability to dissipate heat. Rated from highest to lowest as A, B, or C. An "A" rating indicates the best heat resistance, which is important for high-speed driving and hot weather conditions.',

    title: 'Traction ratio',
    description:
      'Indicates a tire\'s ability to stop on wet pavement. Rated from highest to lowest as AA, A, B, or C. This rating measures the tire\'s grip on wet surfaces, which is crucial for safe braking in rainy conditions.',

    title: 'Load index',
    description:
      'A numerical code that corresponds to the maximum weight a tire can support when properly inflated. Higher numbers indicate higher carrying capacity. This rating is essential for ensuring your tires can safely support your vehicle\'s weight.',

    title: 'Speed rating',
    description:
      'A letter that indicates the maximum speed capability of a tire under optimal conditions. Ratings range from L (75 mph) to Y (186+ mph). Choosing the right speed rating ensures your tires can safely handle your driving needs.',

    title: 'Tire pressure',
    description:
      'The amount of air pressure inside a tire, measured in PSI (pounds per square inch). Maintaining proper tire pressure is critical for optimal performance, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity. The recommended pressure can be found in your vehicle\'s manual or on the driver\'s door jamb.',
