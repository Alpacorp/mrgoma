/**
 * Guards for the store directory.
 *
 * Written after finding, on 2026-08-04, that the Miami Gardens "map link" opened
 * **KeyZoo Locksmiths** — a different business in the same plaza — and that the
 * store's `geo` had been derived from that wrong link, so the coordinates in our
 * JSON-LD had been pointing at the locksmith for as long as the entry existed.
 * Four other stores linked to a bare street address rather than to the business
 * profile, which loses the reviews, hours, photos and call button.
 *
 * None of that could fail a build. It was a plausible-looking URL that nobody
 * had reason to click. These tests make the class of mistake impossible to
 * reintroduce quietly.
