/**
 * What a buyer sees the instant they change page, apply or clear a filter.
 *
 * `/tires` renders on the server on every request, and without this file the
 * App Router showed nothing at all until that render finished: the click gave
 * no sign it had registered. On 2026-09-25 that wait reached 30 s under crawler
 * load, and is still seconds on a normal day, because a single render runs
 * 9–11 catalog queries.
 *
 * The shape follows `page.tsx` — dark hero, then the rail beside the results —
 * so the real page replaces it in place instead of shifting it. The results
 * placeholder is `ResultsSkeleton`, whose width `resultsWidth.guard.test.ts`
 * already holds to the real list's.
