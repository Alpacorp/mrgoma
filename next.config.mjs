/**
 * The site answers on both `mrgomatires.com` and `www.mrgomatires.com`, and
 * until now neither redirected to the other: two origins served the same app.
 *
 * That is not merely untidy. An origin is the boundary for cookies and for web
 * app identity, so the two hosts were two different installs and two different
 * sessions — sign in on one and the session does not exist on the other, and
 * `NEXTAUTH_URL` can only ever name one of them. It is why the staff portal
 * stopped letting people in until they were moved to the `www` address by hand.
 *
 * So one host wins and the other permanently redirects to it. The winner is
 * derived from the same env vars `getSiteUrl()` reads, so the redirect can never
 * disagree with the canonical tags and the sitemap. Only the exact sibling host
 * is matched, which leaves preview deployments and localhost alone.
 *
 * Two things to keep in step, both because this file is loaded before any TS is
 * compiled and so cannot import from `src/app/utils/seo.ts`:
 *
 *  - The literal below must equal `getSiteUrl()`'s own fallback. Neither is
 *    meant to be load-bearing; they are, whenever the env var is unset.
 *  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is deliberately NOT read here. Despite the similar
 *    name it answers a different question — where Stripe returns to and which
 *    origins `/api/instant-quote` accepts — and the two are only equal today by
 *    coincidence.

/**
 * Store URLs that were indexed after the May migration and then renamed by a
 * later deploy without a redirect. They ranked in positions 3–4, Google still
 * shows them, and every click has been landing on a 404 since — so the ranking
 * those pages earned is being discarded instead of inherited by the pages that
 * replaced them.
 *
 * `/locations/miami-north-441` is **deliberately absent**. None of the seven
 * current addresses is on that road, so there is no destination anyone can
 * confirm, and a redirect pointed at the wrong store is worse than the 404 it
 * replaces. It goes in once the owner says which store "441" was.
 *
 * Every destination is checked against `locationsConfig` by
 * `src/app/(shop)/locations/legacySlugs.guard.test.ts`, so renaming a store
 * without updating this list fails the build rather than creating a redirect
 * loop into a 404.
